Data science project on Applicant Tracking system analysis using Thinknum corporate job posting database

This project aims to analyse the usage and popularity of various applicant tracking systems using the dataset collected by tracking the individual job postings on corporate websites. I try to answer two questions for a preliminary proof of concept analysis of ATS systems using this dataset

    What are the most popoular ATS systems?
    Does region have an impact on the popularity of ATS systems?

Further, we can do exploratory analysis on how the trend has been over the years, what kind of corporations use own job protals vs third party ATS systems, how many and what type of job openings are posted on each kind of ATS portal and more...
